# Project 'karly-ts-next'

## Introduction

Personal project to learn Next.js, TypeScript and the other React-related
libraries ( e.g., react-hook-form )

## Project Features

- Migrate the [project 'Karly'](https://github.com/DragonTiger92/Karly)
  - Unlike the product of project 'Karly', the product of this project is made
    as a responsive web app.
    - Responsive features aren't incarnated in the
      [figma draft](https://www.figma.com/design/Jm4FOBWLsQxsrZvn5LZOgI/%EB%A7%88%EC%BC%93%EC%B9%BC%EB%A6%AC?node-id=365-2825&t=ZNEZJtnwkyYX8SL2-1),
      so responsive features are implemented at the discretion of the producer.
- Write text codes using `@storybook/test` module
  - Can test features in `storybook` server
